or Run the APIs in Postman.

## Authentication

The ThriveStack API uses API keys for authentication. You can visit the [API Keys](#) page to create or retrive
your keys.

Your API key is a secret and carry privileges. Do not share your secret API key and be sure to keep them secure!

All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY
```

## Trying Out APIs

There are several ways to try out the APIs,

1. 'Run in Postman' button will take you to ThriveStack's Postman workspace, where in you can directly run the requests
or download/fork the Postman Collections.

2. Built-in 'Try Out' feature for the APIs.
- For REST APIs, the REST API reference pages contain the 'Try Out' section in them.
- For GraphQL APIs, you can access the [GraphQL Explorer!](/getting-started/apis-non-gen/self-serve-apis-try-out).

For more information about 'Try Out' feature, refer this [Guide](/getting-started/apis-non-gen/using-the-try-out-options).
